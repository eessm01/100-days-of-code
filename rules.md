# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code in Python for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
January 29th, 2020.

## Additional Rules
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
