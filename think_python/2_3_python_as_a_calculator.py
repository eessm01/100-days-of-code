""" This program is a solution for:
    1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4 Ï€r3. 
        What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
        Hint: 392.7 is wrong!
    2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. 
        Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. 
        What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
    3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), 
        then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do 
        I get home for breakfast?
